Load the datasets that are present in the repo to the code environment.

Once the datasets are present in the code environment, each code call can be executed from top to bottom.

First the loading dataset code cell has to be run and then the subsequent code cells that analyses the data.

Lastly after all the analysing code cells, the model code block can be run for the training and also predicting the results.
